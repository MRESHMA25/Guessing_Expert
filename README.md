# Guessing_Expert
A Python program assigned by Carleton University, employing branching structures to create a simple expert system. Users choose a movie subgenre and answer "yes-or-no" questions to guess a film title. The program aims to guess within seven tries, guided by a flowchart, and suggests refining questions if unsuccessful.

This program was created by @MRESHMA25.
